      text: "Hello! 👋<br><br>
            My name is Richard Crété, I'm %age% years old and I'm web developer since 2019. I'm based in Alsace (France), the region where I studied and worked in my first agencies.<br><br>
            Over the past few years, I've been able to experiment several languages, frameworks and tools: Symfony (which I really like), Vue.js, Docker, Shopify and WordPress.<br><br>
            In my spare time, I like to travel to ride roller coasters 🎢, play GeoGuessr 📍 and play sports, especially running 🏃."
